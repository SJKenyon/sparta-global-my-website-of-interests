# My website of interests

### General

We were tasked with creating a fully functional front-end website on a topic of our choice. I decided to create a website for my two dogs with seperate pages for more detail.
I used bootstrap (v 3.3.7) and font awesome (v 4.7.0) for added design features.

The whole 'more photos' page is laid out in rows and columns so that it is neat and saves a lot of time with css.

I added a custom mouse icon in the nav bar. A dog shows up as the cursor when hovering over links. The following is my css using the .cur file:
``` css
.custom {
  cursor: url(nat772.cur),auto;
}
```
